# Rest API testing using Rest-Assured Java Framework

- This is repository of basic REST API testing Rest Assured framework
- This framework is developed using **Rest-Assured** library for Rest API testing
- Testing is done by TestNG tool
- Reporting is by Extent Reports

## Prerequisits

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have a JDK installed.
- Maven: A build automation tool for Java projects.
- IDE: A suitable IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
- Rest-Assured: A Java library for testing RESTful APIs.
- First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. 
- You can install Prism globally using npm: npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
- Run mock server manually using: prism mock University.yml
